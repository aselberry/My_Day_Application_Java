# My_Day_Application
It is a Java Program developed to arrange a day of the week, helping students/workers create a schedule, plan what to wear according to the weather conditions, be updated on the recent news, and productively engage in daily activities. 
I built this program to practice my Java programming skills obtained from the online course CodeAcademy. It is currently a user-dependent program as I built this "app" to facilitate my day's schedule and activities. 
However, currently, I am working on integrating the program with Databases. Afterwards, the program will be user-independent, which means any user can adjust it according to their schedule and priorities. 

# Features
1. Offers so-called 'menu" to arrange the day. MyDay assistant has 3 services:

   a. Schedule (Class schedule + new tasks to be added to the schedule)
   b. Recommendations (Here, the user can learn about the weather, fashion and computer science news.)
   c. Timer (It helps the user to identify what to do according to the remaining minutes till the next work/meeting/class. It calculates the given minutes and determines the next steps/actions that could be done before the meeting.)
  
3. Iterates over these options until the user indicates that she/he/they does not need MyDay's assistance for the day.
